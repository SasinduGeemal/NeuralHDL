# NeuralHDL

NeuralHDL is an internal DSL written in scala for hardware design geared towards neural networks. The goal of this project is to create (or expand) a [CAFFE](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) like tool which supports generic neural network designs targetted towards generating configurable hardware. This project is an extension of an existing general purpose hardware DSL ([ScalaDL](https://github.com/andywag/ScalaDL) used in the design of a highly parallel optical modem which has architectural similarities to neural networks.

Detailed documentation and instructions for use can be found here :
